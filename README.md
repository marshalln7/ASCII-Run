Welcome to ASCII Run!

To run this game, open a Python programming IDE that has a good console, and open the console nice and big so that you can see what's going on. Then run the main python file in the repo.

Press space in order to jump, and control to shoot back at the incoming projectiles.

All ASCII art is contained in the .txt files, feel free to edit them at any time!

Best,
Marshall
